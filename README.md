# Landing Page Lead Funnel Validation Tool

An automated web application designed to validate a company's demo booking (or "Book a Demo") conversion flow. This tool tests whether a user can successfully schedule a demo meeting by navigating through the landing page, clicking the appropriate button, and filling out the required forms.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to help companies verify that their landing page's demo booking process is working correctly. The application performs the following steps:
- **Input a Landing Page URL:** Accepts a URL for a companyâ€™s landing page.
- **Button & Form Detection:** Detects and clicks on a "Book a Demo" (or similar) button.
- **Automated Booking Flow:** Navigates through the booking flow, fills in form fields automatically, and submits the booking.
- **Validation:** Confirms that the demo booking process was successful by checking for a confirmation page.
- **Reporting:** Generates a detailed PDF report (with screenshots) outlining the steps taken and any errors encountered.
